# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regreesion is an algorithm for binary classification

## Standard Notations for Logistics Regression
A single training example is represented by a pair, like $`(x,y)`$ where $`x \in \R^{n_x}`$ (x is an $`\R^{n_x}`$ dimensional feature vector) and $`n_x`$ is the input size. $`y \in (0,1)`$ is the predicted output vector. 

$`m`$ denotes the examples in the dataset: $`(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), x^{(2)},y^{(2)}, \dots , x^{(m)},y^{(m)}`$ are the training examples.

$`X \in \R^{n_x \times m}`$ is the input matrix. Here $`n_x`$ is the number of columns and $`m`$ is the number of rows.

$`Y \in R^{1 \times m}`$ is the label matrix.

## Logistic Regression

Given $`x`$, we want to find $`\hat{y}`$ where $` \hat{y} = P(y=1|x)`$.

Parameters: $`w \in \R^{n_x},\ b \in \R`$

Output $`\hat{y} = \sigma (w^T + b)`$. We can also write $`z = w^T x + b`$ where z is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is represented as $`\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}`$. 

If z is large, then $`\sigma(z) \approx 1`$.

If z is large negative number, then $`\sigma(z) \approx 0`$.

## Logistic Regression Cost Function 

We have $`\hat{y} = \sigma(w^Tx+b)`$, where $`\sigma (z) = \frac{1}{1+1+e^{-z}}`$.

Suppose we are given the training set: $`\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), \dots, (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)}) \}`$ and we want $`\hat{y}^{(i)} = y^{(i)} `$. We will use the cost function to analysis this approximation. The cost function of Logsitic Regression is given by:
$` L(\hat{y}, y)  = -(y \text{log} \hat{y})  + (1-y) \text{log}(1-\hat{y}) `$

If $`y=1:\  L(\hat{y}, y)  = -(\text{log} \hat{{y}}) `$

If $`y=0:\ L(\hat{y}, y)  = (1-y) \text{log}(1-\hat{y}) `$

Toghther, it becomes: 

```math
J(w,b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)} ) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \big[ y^{(i)} \text{log} \hat{y}^{(i)} + (1-y^{(i)}) \text{log}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}  ) \big]
```

## Gradient Descent

Check the Data Sciene Toolkit to learn more about usage of Gradient Descent.

After this, we would like to implement the gradient descent on m training examples.

We have the cost function
$`J(w,b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} L(a^{(i)} , y^{(i)}) `$, where $`a^{(i)} = \hat{y}^{(i)} = \sigma (w^Tx^{(i)} + b) `$

Derivating the cost function w.r.t $`w_1`$, we get 

$`\frac{\partial}{\partial w_1}\ J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial} L(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})`$



## Algorithm for Gradient Descent

Initialize $`J = 0,\ dw_1 = 0,\ dw_2 = 0,\ db = 0`$.

```math
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{For } i = 1 \text{ to } & m\\
z^{(i)} &= w^T x^{(i)} + b\\
a^{(i)} &= \sigma(z^{(i)})\\
J+ & = -[ y^{(i)} \text{log}a^{(i)} + (1-y^{(i)}) \text{log}(1-a^{(i)}) ]\\
dz^{(i)} & = a^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\\
dw_1 &+= x^{(i)} dz^{(i)}\\
\vdots\\
dw_n &+= x^{(i)} dz^{(i)}\\
db &+= dz^{(i)}\\
J = J/m& \\
dw_1 = dw_1&/m ;\ dw_2 = dw_2/m;\ \dots dw_n = dw_n/m ; db = db/m
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

Writing a for loop in Python is not considered a good pracitce if we are performing a mathematical calculation which involves a heavy computation. So in our case, instead of writing,

```math
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
dw_1 &+= x^{(i)} dz^{(i)}\\
\vdots\\
dw_n &+= x^{(i)} dz^{(i)}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

in the for loop, we will use the *np.dot* function from the numpy library to perform the computations. So, we are going to get rid of $`dw_1 =0 `$ and $`dw_2 = 0`$, we are going to initialize $`dw`$ by a vector as *dw = np.zeros($`n_x`$, 1)*.

### Vectorizing the Gradient Descent Algorithm

Instead of the for loop we are going to use the vector value operation as *dw +=$x^{(i)}$ dz^{(i)}*

and we will also get rid of the last line in the algorithm $`dw_1 = dw_1/m ;\ dw_2 = dw_2/m;\ \dots dw_n = dw_n/m `$ and replace it with $`dw / = m`$

Now we are also going to elliminate the first for loop that we have. Instead we are going to use the numpy arrays to carry out the mathematical operations.

So $`X \in \R^{n_x \times m}`$ matrix.

$`w^T = \R^{(1, n_x)}`$ will be row vector.

$`z = [z^{(1)}\ \dots z^{(m)}]` = w^T X [b \dots b]  = [w^T x^{(1)}+ b \ w^T x^{(2)}+b \dots w^T x^{(m)} +b ]`$

Thus $`z = \text{np.dot(w.T, x) + b}`$ in Python.

At last, $`A = [a^{(1)} \ a^{(2)} \dots a^{(m)} ] = \sigma(z) `$
