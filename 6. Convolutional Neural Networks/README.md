# Convolutional Neural Networks

These files contain the matter from 4th course of Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. 

I have learned to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems. While going through the course, I discovered some powerful practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs, straight from the research papers, then applied transfer learning to my own deep CNN. I also applied the new knowledge of CNNs to one of the hottest and challenging fields in computer vision: object detection. At the end, I explored how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, then implement my own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!

Topics to be covered in this are: 

- Foundations of CNN
    - Explaination of the convolution operations
    - Apply two different types of pooling operations (Max and Average Pooling)
    - Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
    - Build a convolutional neural network
    - Implement convolutional and pooling layers in numpy, including forward propagation
    - Implement helper functions to use when implementing a TensorFlow model
